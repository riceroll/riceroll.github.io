  <p>A robot's morphology is pivotal to its functionality, as seen in natural systems where octopi squeeze through small apertures and caterpillars use peristaltic shape changes to navigate diverse environments. While existing robotic systems struggle to achieve precise volumetric transformations, Variable Geometry Truss (VGT) systems show strong morphological capabilities resulting from their large numbers of actuating beams, enabling volumetric shape changes. However, current VGTs face scalability issues due to control complexity that increases exponentially with the number of beams, resulting in physical implementations limited to either a few tetrahedral units or minimal actuatable beams. Previous work simplified control by grouping actuators into synchronized subnetworks through shared air channels, yet relied on manual design for network assignments and control sequences. We introduce metatruss, an optimization framework that builds upon this actuation mechanism through a tailored multi-objective genetic algorithm to automate the computation of actuator grouping, contraction ratios, and control sequences. We developed a highly-damped dynamical simulator that balances computational efficiency with physical accuracy, validated through experimental prototypes with trajectory differences of 4.38% over 86.0 cm displacement. Through diverse robotic implementations, we show that metatruss can achieve complex morphological adaptations while maintaining control simplicity. Empirical results validate the hypothesis that there exists an optimal number of control networks for a given metatruss, beyond which additional networks yield diminishing returns in performance across multiple tasks.

<!-- 
Recent studies show that a robot's morphology is pivotal to its functionality~\cite{shah_shape_2021}. Biological organisms demonstrate this through their ability to adjust body structure and stiffness to accommodate environmental demands - octopi squeeze through small apertures, while caterpillars use peristaltic shape changes to navigate diverse environments. This adaptability becomes indispensable for robots facing tasks such as fitting into tight spaces, conforming to objects, or inducing specific human emotions and cognitive responses. However, such dynamic plasticity that enables robust operation in natural environments remains a challenge for most artificial systems.

\q{c4_0}{
Robotic systems with adaptive morphology demonstrate the ability to change shapes, including volumetric transformations, continuously. Bar-joint robots use interconnected bars and joints as linear or rotational actuators, but are often limited to tree topologies~\cite{robogrammar, metaMorph, embodiedIntelligenceLearning2021} or single-bar limbs~\cite{lipsonAutomaticGolem2000}, restricting their shape expressiveness and weight-bearing capacity. Multi-material voxel robots~\cite{unshacklingEvolutionCubicRobot, evolvedElectrophysiologicalSoft_cubicRobot, evolvingSoftRobotsInTightSpace, cheney_scalable_2018}, composed of regular cubic units (voxels) with different material properties, offer diverse shape changes by activating specific voxels. However, they face challenges in scalability and real-world precision due to their solid volume nature and the non-linear interactions between connected voxels. Magnetic self-reconfigurable cubic robots~\cite{zykov_robotics_2005, mitCubeRobot} allow reassembling of voxelated shapes through magnetic connections but lack structural integrity and continuous motion, limiting their practical applications. Other approaches include robots with variable limb lengths~\cite{sun_embedded_2023, nygaard_real-world_2021}, morphing wheels~\cite{sihite_multi-modal_2023}, and 2D origami or soft sheet robots~\cite{shah_soft_2021, belke_morphological_2023}. However, these designs often have limited degrees of freedom and control precision or are constrained to specific morphologies, highlighting the need for more versatile and scalable solutions in adaptive robotic systems that can achieve complex, three-dimensional shape changes while maintaining structural integrity and precise control.

}

\q{c4_1}{
Among the various approaches to address these challenges, variable geometry truss (VGT) systems stand out among robotic designs that offer morphological complexity and adaptability. VGTs, composed of beams and joints that form tetrahedral or octahedral truss structures, achieve diverse transformations such as rotation, twisting, linear, and volumetric scaling through actuator beams. This flexibility enables VGTs to perform standard robotic tasks such as locomotion~\cite{usevitch_locomotion_2020, liu_motion_2020}, manipulation~\cite{hughes_trussarmvariable-geometry-truss_1991, miura_design_1984}, and target targeting, as well as specialized activities requiring morphological adaptations~\cite{kovacs_trussformer_2018, spinos_towards_2017, curtis_tetrahedral_2007, pieber_adaptive_2018}. Despite their advantages in degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) and versatility, current VGTs face scalability issues due to the complexity of their control systems, which scale exponentially with the number of beams~\cite{hamlin_tetrobot_1997}. Therefore, existing VGT with physical implementations are either having a few tetrahedral units~\cite{qin_trussbot_2022, hughes_trussarmvariable-geometry-truss_1991, spinos_variable_2017} or only a few beams are actuable~\cite{kovacs_trussformer_2018}, restricting their achievable motions.

\q{intro_4}{
Previously, researchers have introduced a novel approach to simplifying the control of complex truss robots~\cite{gu_pneumesh_2022}, a strategy for grouping actuator air channels into networks, termed C-networks. 
By grouping pneumatic actuators with interconnected joints, each subgroup of actuators in the same C-network can be actuated simultaneously with a single air valve as the controller (Fig. ~\ref{fig_1_introduction} b). Although the total number of actuators does not change, the number of controllers decreased. With varying combinations of the actuation states of the C-networks, the metatruss deforms into different morphologies and the number of possible morphologies exponentially scales as the number of C-networks increases (Fig.~\ref{fig_1_introduction} b). Moreover, under a temporal sequence of actuation signals, the truss transforms into a series of morphologies and performs a sequential motion. Additionally, they enabled each actuator to have different preset contraction ratios through a blocker structure. This approach aims to simplify the system and control complexities inherent in complex truss robots.
Although it introduced a design and simulation tool that allows designers to assign the beam connectivity manually, no optimization or automated design pipeline was introduced. As the truss becomes more intricate and tasks grow in complexity, manually navigating C-network assignment becomes tedious and intractable. 
}

\q{intro_5}{
In nature, humans and other animals, despite having hundreds of muscles and billions of muscle cells, execute complex movements without consciously controlling each muscle's contraction. Research indicates that animals may use a control strategy known as synergy~\cite{kerkman_muscle_2020, giszter_convergent_1993, torres-oviedo_muscle_2006, ting_limited_2005}. This mechanism, also present in humans, reduces neural pathway complexity~\cite{torres-oviedo_muscle_2006}. With synergy in human motor control, intricate actions such as walking or jumping are executed by periodically coordinating a muscle network, eliminating the need for conscious control of every individual muscle. As such, many muscles operate concurrently when engaging in activities that require collaborative muscle actuation. Although the topic remains under debate, several researchers argue that this coordinated approach achieves an optimal balance between actuator count and control complexity, significantly reducing the computational burden of the brain~\cite{macpherson_strategies_1988, davella_combinations_2003, rana_brain_2015}. 
Inspired by biological muscle synergy, where complex movements are achieved through efficiently coordinated muscle groups rather than individual control, we propose a similar principle for the metatruss. We hypothesize that there exists an optimal number of C-networks for a given metatruss, beyond which additional networks yield a diminishing increase in performance across various multiple tasks. 
}


\q{intro_6}{
To validate this hypothesis, we developed a multi-objective optimization pipeline using a tailored hierarchical genetic algorithm (Fig.~\ref{fig_1_introduction}c, d). This approach was chosen because the discrete nature of C-network assignments and the topological constraints of the network make traditional gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable. Our genetic algorithm incorporates custom operators that respect both symmetry and connectivity constraints while exploring the design space. The pipeline simultaneously optimizes three key aspects: the assignment of actuators to C-networks (determining which actuators work together), the preset contraction levels of individual actuators (defining actuators' motion), and the temporal actuation sequences (controlling when each C-network activates). This multi-level optimization allows us to find designs that balance the competing demands of control simplicity and task performance while maintaining physical feasibility.
}

\q{intro_7}{
Our hypothesis is supported by an empirical study. We demonstrate that for a complex truss robot with multiple functional objectives - specifically, a quadruped metatruss bot tasked with four distinct functions - a limited number of C-networks can yield competitive performance (Fig.~\ref{fig_1_introduction}d, i, j, Supplementary Video 1). This finding is significant in comparison to the existing literature. Our proposed design method and optimization approach notably enhance the ratio of total actuating beams to the complexity of the control system, offering a unique contribution to the field (Fig.~\ref{fig_1_introduction} k). Furthermore, we showed five different truss topologies with various tasks to show the topology and task diversity of our system. We built a physical prototype of one metatruss to validate the physical feasibility and compare its trajectory with the simulation to show the high accuracy of the simulator.
